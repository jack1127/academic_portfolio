System programming is much more complex than only C language.
There are countless function or command that I've never heard, so I need to consult them and find new questions "recursively".
At the beginning, it's almost a nightmare for me.
Since I still don't know much about "system programming" run. 
I copy and modify the code on the ppt shown in class and finish my hw with lots of help from my classmates.
Therefore, I am not sure whether it will be too similar with others' also done this way, but I really do it myself.
